# Stage 7 Code Review Report

## Review Scope

- Range: `0f21e97..4c8ec8f`
- Shared remote session ordering and move semantics
- macOS/iOS Viewer persistence, rename and unpair lifecycle
- macOS sidebar/menu/keyboard ordering and iOS edit-mode integration

## Findings

- Critical / High / Medium / Low: none.
- No P1, P2 or P3 defect survived verification.

## Verification

- `RemoteSessionOrder` and settings tests: 8/8 passed.
- macOS package compilation through `swift test`: passed.
- macOS `ClaudeSpyServer` App target build: passed.
- iOS `ClaudeSpy` generic-device App target build: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- SwiftLint was unavailable locally; the macOS build reported the existing install hint only.

## Residual Risk

- Native macOS drag and iOS Edit/Done gestures have not yet been manually exercised on real UI.
  The shared move coordinates, persistence and both platform compilation paths are covered.

## Assessment

Approved for integration into `develop/v3.0.0`.
