# opencode plugin for CtrlX

A CtrlX **sidecar plugin** that teaches the CtrlX (ClaudeSpy) Mac app to
monitor [opencode](https://opencode.ai) sessions running in tmux panes: track
working / done / idle, raise the attention badge, fire notifications on turn
completion, render opencode's permission prompts as interactive CtrlX/iOS
forms that answer back into opencode, and surface a per-session token / cost /
latency / model meter via OTLP telemetry.

## Architecture

opencode removed config-based shell hooks (the old `experimental.hook`), so this
plugin observes opencode through its **plugin system** instead. Two pieces:

```

```

1. **`opencode-bridge/ctrlx.js`** — an opencode plugin (auto-loaded from
   `~/.config/opencode/plugin/`). Its `event` hook forwards the lifecycle events
   CtrlX cares about to CtrlX's Unix-domain *ingress socket*. It bakes in
   the socket path + plugin id at install time and passes through `TMUX_PANE`
   (routing), `serverUrl`, and the project dir. It also emits two *synthetic*
   frames opencode itself never fires: `ctrlx.lifecycle.started` when opencode
   loads it (≈ TUI start) and `ctrlx.lifecycle.stopped` from its `dispose` hook
   (≈ TUI quit) — see **Session lifecycle** below.
2. **`bin/sidecar`** — the long-lived Python process CtrlX spawns. It maps
   opencode events to CtrlX's `AgentState` and answers permission/question
   forms by injecting keystrokes into the pane (opencode's TUI has no reachable
   HTTP endpoint).

## Event mapping

| opencode event | → CtrlX state |
|---|---|
| `ctrlx.lifecycle.started` (synthetic, on bridge load) | `idle` (session appears) |
| `session.created` / `session.updated` | *(tracking only — learns subagent sessions; see below)* |
| `session.status` `busy` / `retry` | `working` |
| `session.status` `idle` (after a turn) | `doneWorking(summary)` + notification (see [Turn summaries](#turn-summaries)) |
| `session.status` `idle` (fresh session) | `idle` |
| `session.idle` (deprecated alias) | `doneWorking(summary)` (turn end) |
| `session.error` | `doneWorking(summary)` + notification |
| `permission.asked` / `permission.updated` | `awaitingPermission` (form) + notification |
| `permission.replied` | `working` (form cleared) |
| `question.asked` | `awaitingReplies` (form) + notification |
| `ctrlx.lifecycle.stopped` (synthetic, on `dispose`) | `sessionEnded` (session removed) |

The sidecar keeps a per-session `working`/`seen` flag so a turn-ending `idle`
becomes `doneWorking` (raising attention) while a brand-new session's first
`idle` stays `idle`, and a stray second `idle` never clears the attention badge.

## Subagents (issue #670)

opencode runs each `task`-tool **subagent** in its own **child session** — a real
session node whose `info.parentID` points at the session that spawned it. That
child emits its own `session.status` `busy` → `idle` churn, structurally identical
to the main session's. If CtrlX surfaced it, **every finished subagent would
fire a spurious "Finished working" notification** (and briefly re-stamp the pane
onto a now-dead child session), even though the main agent is still mid-turn.

The wrinkle: `session.status` / `session.idle` deliberately **omit `parentID`**
(opencode [#30043](https://github.com/sst/opencode/issues/30043)), so the status
event alone can't tell a subagent's idle from the main session's. The only events
that carry `info.parentID` are `session.created` / `session.updated`. So the
bridge forwards those two (they map to no state themselves), the sidecar records
each child in a `CHILD` map (child id → parent id), and it then **drops all
lifecycle events** (`session.status` / `session.idle` / `session.error`) belonging
to a child session. Only the **root** session (no `parentID`) drives the pane's
working / done state and its turn-completion notification — so one turn using N
subagents yields exactly **one** "Finished working", when the main agent finishes.

Two refinements on top of the drop rule:

- **Ordering** — opencode dispatches plugin `event` hooks without awaiting them,
  so the bridge pushes every ingress frame through a FIFO send chain (and the
  `event` hook awaits it). That guarantees a child's `session.created` reaches
  the sidecar before the child's own busy/idle churn — the learn-then-drop logic
  can't lose the race.
- **Permissions / questions are NOT dropped** — a subagent *can* raise its own
  `permission.asked` / `question.asked` (its ruleset only denies `todowrite` /
  `task`), and opencode's TUI renders a child's pending prompt in the **root
  session's view**, blocking the whole turn on it. The sidecar forwards these,
  **re-keyed to the root session** (`CHILD` is a map precisely so the parent
  chain can be walked, including nested subagents), so the remote form appears
  and keystroke answers land in the pane — without the child id ever becoming
  the pane's session.

> Re-install note: because the *bridge* now forwards `session.created` /
> `session.updated`, an already-installed bridge must be re-installed (Agents
> settings → **Install**) for the fix to take effect. Until then behavior is
> unchanged (the old bug), never worse.

## Turn summaries

Claude Code's "Finished working" notifications carry the agent's last message
(`lastAssistantMessage` from its Stop hook); opencode's turn-end events carry
**no text at all**. So at turn end the bridge fetches it: when a **root** session
that previously went `busy` reports `idle`, the bridge calls
`client.session.messages({ path: { id } })` on the **in-process SDK client**
(every opencode plugin receives one; it works even though opencode's server
listens on a unix socket, which is what makes the server unreachable from the
*sidecar*) and attaches the last assistant message's visible text — synthetic /
ignored parts filtered, trimmed to 300 chars like the pi bridge — to the idle
event as `properties.ctrlxSummary`. The sidecar surfaces it as
`doneWorking`'s summary (shown in the sidebar row) and the notification body,
falling back to the old "Finished — *project*" copy when absent.

Ordering: the fetch is kicked off when the idle event arrives (capturing the
messages as they stand at turn end) but its result is awaited **inside the FIFO
send chain** — awaiting it in the hook body instead would let a new turn's
`busy` frame overtake the still-fetching idle frame and fire a spurious
"finished". The fetch self-times-out after 2s and never rejects; on any failure
the idle frame goes out untouched. Subagent idles (dropped by the sidecar
anyway) and session-switch idles (no turn ended) skip the fetch entirely.

> Re-install note: the summary fetch lives in the *bridge*, so an
> already-installed bridge must be re-installed (Agents settings → **Install**)
> to start carrying summaries. Older sidecars simply ignore the extra field.

## Session lifecycle (start / exit)

opencode fires **no event** when it launches into a fresh idle prompt, and none
when it quits — and CtrlX's process scan only re-detects agents when a tmux
pane is *added or removed*, not when a process starts or dies inside a live pane.
So neither launching nor quitting opencode would update the sidebar on its own.
The bridge closes that gap with two synthetic frames (matching Claude Code's
`SessionStart` → idle / `SessionEnd` → session removed; no notifications):

- **Start** — the bridge's plugin factory runs once when opencode loads it
  (≈ TUI start), and forwards `ctrlx.lifecycle.started`. The sidecar maps it to
  `idle`, so the session shows up immediately (idle moon glyph + project name)
  before the first turn.
- **Exit** — the bridge registers opencode's `dispose` hook, which opencode runs
  as a shutdown finalizer on a graceful quit (the quit command, `/exit`, Ctrl-C).
  It forwards `ctrlx.lifecycle.stopped` (awaited so the frame flushes before the
  process dies). The sidecar emits `AppAction.sessionEnded` keyed by the **pane
  id**, so the host removes the session (the icon reverts to a plain terminal).
  `closePaneEligible` honors the `close_pane_on_session_end` setting (default off →
  the pane stays open). Verified against opencode v1.17.11 for both `/exit` and
  Ctrl-C. The one uncovered case is a **hard kill** (`SIGKILL`/crash): opencode
  skips finalizers, so no `stopped` frame is sent and the stale session lingers
  until CtrlX next reconciles.

## Answering forms (permissions & questions)

opencode raises two interactive forms, both rendered by CtrlX/iOS and answered
back by **keystroke injection** into the pane — the same mechanism the built-in
agents use. (opencode's TUI talks to its server over a unix socket and exposes no
reachable TCP HTTP endpoint, so the reported `serverUrl` can't be POSTed to; keys
are the transport-agnostic path. Verified against opencode v1.17.11.)

**Permission** (`permission.asked` → `awaitingPermission`) — a left/right list
"Allow once" / "Allow always" / "Reject":

| CtrlX response | keystrokes |
|---|---|
| allow | `Enter` |
| allow + "Allow always" | `Right, Enter, Enter` |
| deny / deny-with-feedback | `Escape` (no inline feedback box for top-level sessions) |

**Question** (`question.asked` → `awaitingReplies`) — maps opencode's QuestionInfo
(`question`/`header`/`options`/`multiple`/`custom`) onto CtrlX's
`AskUserQuestionRequest` (supports multiple questions + multi-select + free text).
Answered via opencode's TUI **number keys** (`1`-`9` jump to a row AND activate
it):

- **One single-select question** (no tabs): press the option's number → picks and
  submits. Free text → number of the "Type your own answer" row, type, `Enter`.
- **Multi-select / multiple questions** (tabbed, one tab per question + a Confirm
  tab): press the number of each selected option (multi-select **toggles**;
  single-select **picks** and auto-advances to the next tab), `Right` to advance a
  multi-select question, then `Enter` on the Confirm tab submits the whole set.

Verified against opencode v1.17.11's `question.tsx`. Edge cases left for follow-up:
questions with >9 rows (number keys only reach 9) and a model that pre-selects
options in its tool call (the sidecar assumes an empty initial selection).

## Telemetry (token / cost / latency meter)

opencode sessions get the same per-session meter as Claude Code — with **no
third-party plugin and no user-set `OPENCODE_*` env vars** (issue #617).
opencode has no usable native OTEL export, but the bridge already rides its
event bus: on every **completed assistant message** (`message.updated` with
`time.completed` set) it POSTs one OTLP/JSON log record to CtrlX's loopback
OTLP receiver (`/v1/logs`, plain `fetch`, fire-and-forget, deduped by message
id). `message.updated` is never forwarded to the ingress socket — telemetry is
the OTLP channel, and the event fires on every streaming metadata change.

- The record's event name is `opencode.api_request` and its attributes mirror
  Claude's `api_request` vocabulary exactly (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`
  with reasoning folded in, `cache_read_tokens`, `cache_creation_tokens`,
  `cost_usd` — opencode computes cost itself, `duration_ms` =
  `time.completed − time.created`, `model` = `modelID`), so the manifest's
  `otlp` declaration (`{"namespace": "opencode"}`) is all the host needs to
  aggregate it additively.
- **Join key:** `session.id` carries **opencode's own session id**
  (`info.sessionID`, `ses_…`). The host stamps a pane's telemetry join key from
  the `sessionID` the sidecar reports in its `PluginEvent`s, and for every real
  opencode event that is the opencode session id (the pane id is only reported
  by the synthetic launch frame, before any turn) — so the record must carry
  the same id or it never joins after the first turn starts. The meter
  therefore follows the pane's *active* opencode session; switching sessions
  resets the visible meter like Claude's `/clear` (the receiver keeps each
  session's running totals, so switching back restores them on the next
  completed message).
- **Endpoint baking:** the opencode process doesn't inherit CtrlX's env, so
  the sidecar substitutes `__CTRLX_OTLP_ENDPOINT__` in the bridge at
  `install` time (from the `initialize` env's `otlpReceiverEndpoint` — the port
  the receiver *actually* bound that launch), exactly like the ingress socket
  path. Running the bridge straight from the repo falls back to the
  `CTRLX_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var for smoke tests. If no receiver was running
  at install, an empty endpoint is baked and telemetry stays off. Re-run
  **Install** after the fact (or after the receiver's port changes) to re-bake.

## Install (development)

```bash
./scripts/dev-install.sh          # copy into ~/.ctrlx/plugins/opencode/
# restart CtrlX, then in Settings enable the plugin and click Install
# (drops opencode-bridge/ctrlx.js into ~/.config/opencode/plugin/ctrlx.js)
```

`ctrlx plugin list` should show `opencode` (source `folder`). Start opencode
in a CtrlX-managed pane (`opencode`) and drive a turn — the session appears
in the sidebar and flips to "needs attention" when the turn finishes.

## Projects in the "+" menu

opencode projects appear in CtrlX's sidebar "+" (new session) menu, the same
as Claude Code / Codex. opencode stores its projects in a SQLite DB
(`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`, respecting `XDG_DATA_HOME`); the sidecar
reads it read-only (`mode=ro`, WAL-aware — WAL readers never block the writer, so
it never perturbs a running opencode) on `refresh_projects` (fired at startup and
every ~60s) and on `initialize`, and emits `set_projects`. Projects whose
directory no longer exists are filtered out; `lastUsed` (from
`project.time_updated`) drives recency sorting.

opencode keys a project by its git **repo**, not folder, and records only the
first worktree it saw. A repo with multiple `git worktree`s would therefore show
just one — whichever opencode happened to record. The scan expands each stored
`worktree` into **every** worktree of its repo (`git worktree list --porcelain`),
so the main checkout and each linked worktree are individually launchable
(deduped across rows). The recorded worktree keeps opencode's own name; the
others are labeled by folder basename. Non-git dirs and a missing `git` fall back
to the stored path unchanged.

> Note: a *just-created* opencode project lives in the DB's WAL until opencode
> checkpoints it into the main `.db` file. `mode=ro` reads committed WAL frames so
> it surfaces right away; the scan only falls back to `immutable=1` (WAL-blind)
> when plain `mode=ro` can't open — a stale `-wal` with no `-shm` and no directory
> write access, i.e. opencode isn't running.

## Settings (Agents tab)

The plugin uses CtrlX's generic sidecar settings, so the Agents settings panel
works out of the box:

- **Command path** — optional override for the launch command. Empty → the sidecar
  launches bare `opencode` (resolved on PATH). The value is delivered to the
  sidecar via `apply_settings` and used by `command_for_launch`.
- **Auto-run** — when off, `command_for_launch` returns null so CtrlX doesn't
  auto-start opencode in project panes.
- **Config Folders** — the default row is `~/.config/opencode` (declared via the
  manifest's `sidecar.default_config_root`); its **Install** writes the bridge to
  `~/.config/opencode/plugin/ctrlx.js` (global). Add a project folder to install
  the bridge into that project's `.opencode/plugin/` instead (per-project install,
  honored via the `install` RPC's `configRoot`).

## Test

```bash
python3 tests/test_sidecar.py     # 42 tests: mapping, lifecycle, subagents, forms, install, telemetry, projects
node --check opencode-bridge/ctrlx.js
```

## Debugging the bridge

Set `CTRLX_OPENCODE_DEBUG=1` in the environment opencode runs in. Every event
the bridge sees (and which it forwards) is logged to
`~/.ctrlx/state/plugins/opencode/logs/bridge-debug.log`
(override with `CTRLX_OPENCODE_DEBUG_LOG`). The sidecar's own stderr is at
`~/.ctrlx/state/plugins/opencode/logs/stderr.log`.

## Known limitations / follow-ups

- opencode has no plan-approval form, so `awaitingPlanApproval` is unused;
  permission prompts (`awaitingPermission`) and questions (`awaitingReplies`) are
  both interactive.
- A **hard kill** of opencode (`SIGKILL`/crash) skips its `dispose` finalizer, so
  no `ctrlx.lifecycle.stopped` frame is sent and the session lingers in the
  sidebar until CtrlX next reconciles (graceful `/exit` and Ctrl-C are covered).
- The telemetry meter shows the pane's **active** opencode session (the join
  key re-stamps on every reported event), so it resets visually when you switch
  sessions inside one TUI; the baked OTLP endpoint goes stale if the receiver
  later binds a different port (re-run Install to re-bake).
- Live event names confirmed against opencode v1.17.11; the bridge forwards a
  broad allowlist (both `permission.asked` and the SDK-typed `permission.updated`)
  to stay correct across versions.
- Formal E2E-suite integration (the Swift `macStageSidecarFixture` path only
  stages the bundled Swift `EchoPluginSidecar`); this plugin is covered by the
  standalone Python tests instead. The declared-namespace telemetry pipeline
  itself (manifest `otlp` → receiver → meter) has E2E coverage via the echo
  fixture (`PluginOTLPTelemetryScenario`).
