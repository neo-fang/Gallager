/// Regression coverage for issue #642: after a device reconnects (e.g. a viewer
/// that switched networks), the *old* half-open socket's `onClose` fires later
/// and used to unregister the live replacement connection — evicting it from the
/// routing table and falsely telling the peer the device disconnected.
///
/// The fix (`ConnectionHub.unregisterIfCurrent`) only tears a connection down
/// when the closing socket is still the registered one, so a stale close is a
/// no-op.
///
/// These tests drive the real WebSocket lifecycle against a running relay: they
/// open two viewer sockets for the same pair (the second replaces the first in
/// `ConnectionHub`), then close the *first* and assert the live replacement keeps
/// routing and the host is never told the viewer left. `deviceId` isn't validated
/// on upgrade, so distinct viewer sockets simply model "same viewer, new socket".
///
/// Nested under `EnvSerializedSuites` to bound how many full Vapor apps boot
/// concurrently (see that container's doc for why setenv is banned here).
