/// Regression coverage for the client half of issue #642: a network switch leaves
/// the viewer's WebSocket **half-open** (dead TCP, no `receive()` error), so the
/// client sat in `.connected` (green dot) forever while nothing flowed.
///
/// The fix is a pong-timeout watchdog in `pingLoop`: each keep-alive ping sets an
/// `awaitingPong` flag that any inbound frame clears. Two consecutive silent
/// rounds confirm the socket is half-open before the normal reconnection path runs.
///
/// This test models a half-open socket with a **mute** relay — it accepts the
/// WebSocket upgrade and then sends nothing (no pong, no data), which is exactly
/// how a half-open socket looks to the client. A live watchdog must notice the
/// dead cycle and reconnect; the mute server counts the reconnection as a second
/// upgrade. Without the watchdog the client stays connected forever and only ever
/// opens one socket.
///
/// `ViewerRelayClient` is `@MainActor`, so the test is too. Intervals are injected
/// (1s/1s) so the watchdog fires in seconds rather than the production 20s/10s.
