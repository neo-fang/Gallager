"""
Fake editor stand-in for E2E testing of the "Open in Editor" feature.

Behaves just enough like a real editor for the macOS app's `EditorClient` to
launch us as if we were a registered application. We immediately write the
file path we received as our first argument to a known location under the
host's `$TMPDIR` so the test scenario can verify the editor was invoked with
the expected file.

Usage: python3 fake_editor.py <file_path> [<file_path>...]
